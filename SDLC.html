<h2>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)</h2>

<p><b>Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.</b> SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.</p2>

<p>The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements. SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users’ requirements.</p>

<h3>Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle</h3>
<p>SDLC specifies the task(s) to be performed at various stages by a software engineer or developer. It ensures that the end product is able to meet the customer’s expectations and fits within the overall budget. Hence, it’s vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this software development process. </p>



<h3>SDLC METHODOLIGES</h3>
<h4>What are SDLC Methodologies?</h4>

<p>SDLC Methodologies are processes and practices used by software development teams in order to successfully navigate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

We’re not just here to provide you with an exhaustive list of obscure SDLC methodologies. Instead, we’re going to set the record straight on SDLC Methodologies. On the web, you’ll find articles that will define and explain a long list of SDLC Methodologies and give a brief summary of each so you can “choose” which is best for your project. It seems simple and harmless enough, but this is not how SDLC methodologies are used in the professional software development world.

Most legacy SDLC methodologies aren’t even taught in University or bootcamp classrooms. Instead, today’s classes teach Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. Despite this, SDLC methodologies have indeed evolved greatly over time, to the point where once-ubiquitous methodologies like Waterfall have become obsolete and irrelevant other than serving as the history that helps us understand the birth of Agile.

Today, the dominant SDLC methodology used by professional software organizations is Agile along with the many Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban that extend its principles beyond software development.
To understand the story of SDLC Methodologies, it is best to look at them chronologically. And while there are a number of methodologies that have been tried, all of them except the Agile family has fallen out of use today. You could even say we live in a Post-Agile world.</p>
